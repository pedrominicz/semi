# Semi

A text bulletin board website made with [Spring][0] and [Vue.js][1]. The main features of this project are:

- Anyone can register and post public messages
- Messages can be tagged, searched and filtered
- Special administrator accounts can delete any message and create and delete tags
- HTTP token bearer authentication using [JSON Web Tokens][2]
- CRUD functionality uses JPA/JPQL object-relational mapping

The name of this project, Semi, is an abbreviation of _semihemidemisemiquaver_, which is the name given to a hundred twenty-eighth note. That is, a node played for 1/128 of the duration of a whole note. The name symbolizes the strict deadline I set myself for this project.
